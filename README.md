# MERN App With Kerberos Auth Example

## Introduction

Implementing Kerberos authentication into a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) app can be a complex task, as it involves integrating several different technologies and components. Here's a general overview of the steps involved:

 1. Install the necessary dependencies:
 ```bash
- "kerberos" library for Node.js

- "passport-kerberos" library for Passport.js

- "express-session" middleware for session management

```

2. Configure the Kerberos server and client:
```bash
- Create a Kerberos realm and a Kerberos principal on the server.

- Generate a Kerberos keytab file that contains the server's credentials.

- Configure the client to use the server's keytab file to authenticate.
```

3. Integrate Kerberos authentication into the MERN app: 
```bash
- Use "passport-kerberos" to configure Passport.js to use Kerberos authentication.

- Use "express-session" to manage user sessions.

- Create routes that require authentication and use Passport.js middleware to authenticate users.

- Use "kerberos" library to validate user credentials and retrieve user information.
```

4. Test the Kerberos authentication:

```bash
- Verify that users can successfully authenticate using Kerberos.

- Verify that authenticated users can access protected routes in the app.
```

5 . Set the realm and KDC keytab path for the krb5 module :

- We set the krb5.realm and krb5.kdc variables to the appropriate values for our server environment. We also set the krb5.keytabPath variable to the path of the keytab file that contains the necessary authentication information :

```bash
krb5.realm = 'MYREALM.COM'; (MYREALM is MSM in This example Which Is My Name )
krb5.kdc = 'kdc.myrealm.com'; (myrealm is MSM in This example Which Is My Name )
krb5.keytabPath = '/path/to/keytab/file';
```

Note that the krb5 module must be configured before it is used to authenticate the user. Therefore, we set the configuration variables at the beginning of the file, before defining the passport strategies and setting up the login and logout endpoints.

## Creation Of Keytab File :

Creating keytab files requires administrative access to the Kerberos realm and the KDC, and the ability to create and manage service principals. It's important to follow best practices for keytab management and keep keytab files secure to prevent unauthorized access.

1. Create a service principal in your Kerberos realm using the kadmin command-line tool. For example, to create a service principal for a web application with a hostname of app.example.com, you could use the following command :

```bash
kadmin: addprinc -randkey HTTP/app.msm.com
```

2. Generate a keytab file for the service principal using the ktadd command in kadmin. For example, to generate a keytab file for the HTTP/app.example.com principal, you could use the following command:
```bash
kadmin: ktadd -k /path/to/app.keytab HTTP/app.msm.com 
```
( This would create a keytab file named app.keytab in the directory specified by /path/to/. 
)

3. Copy the keytab file to the server where your application is running, and make sure the file has the appropriate permissions and is owned by the user account that will be running the application

4. Configure your application to use the keytab file for authentication. The specific steps for this will depend on the programming language and framework you are using for your application.

 Note that these are general steps, and the exact commands and procedures may vary depending on the specific Kerberos implementation you are using and the policies of your organization. It's important to follow best practices for keytab management and keep keytab files secure to prevent unauthorized access.
